# PR Artifact Schema v1.0.0

This document defines the canonical PR artifact markdown contract generated by
`--output-pr-artifact-format markdown`.

## Contract version

- `schema_version`: `1.0.0`
- `artifact_type`: `pr-review`

## Output shape

The file is rendered in two parts:

1. YAML-like front matter block
2. Markdown body with required sections

### Front matter

```yaml
---
schema_version: 1.0.0
title: "Refactor: <directive>"
generated_at: "<iso8601>"
risk: "low|medium|high|critical"
artifact_type: pr-review
---
```

### Body sections (required)

1. `# <title>`
2. `## Executive Summary`
3. `## Quality and Validation`
4. `## Task Status`
5. `## Changed files`
6. `## Reviewer checklist`
7. `## Rollback instructions`

## Error semantics

`Risk` and `Quality and Validation` entries are derived from run results.
`Error count` in markdown is derived from failed/skipped task totals.
